# Password Generator Project

## Javascript, HTML, and CSS


### Description

    * The focus of this project is to make this application generate a random password between 8 to 128 characters using Javascript. This was based on a set of user criteria of letters, numbers, and symbols. 
    
    * Letters cannot be used when the screen prompts the user "how long is the password", as well as if a number less than 8 or greater than 128 characters is chosen a screen prompt is given and the user will start over.

    * It starts with clicking on the "generate password" button and a series of questions are asked as stated above. The creation of this page is very simple and helpful when needing a quick password to copy and paste into your new login site. 
    


## What We Learned

    * The various functions helped drive this application to make it successful such as the randomInt(min,max) on line 4. These functions work in conjunction with line 9 variable and line 13 function to work with the for loop on line 74 to generate a random password. These tell which list to pull from and gives it a random order. 

    * The If statements are there to define the different scenarios of when and what the user inputs and the application will confirm the correct response or deny the incorrect responses based on the guidelines of the application.

    * We learned to define many variables for this application such as the uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers 0 - 9, and symbols as well as variables to prompt the user to select what type of characters they want.

    * The true or false statements were key in creating the functionality of this application. When the window prompts the user to select a character, Ok confirms the selection and Cancel denies it.
	 
    * If no character option is selected then a password of just all uppercase letters is generated. An else statement can replace the if statement on line 64 to force the user to have to choose at least one character option. This is can be added for the client in case they would like to explore this further.
